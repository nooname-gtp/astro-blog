According to its own home page, Pages CMS is the “The No-Hassle CMS for Static Site Generators,” and I’ll to attest to that. Pages CMS has largely been developed by a single developer, [Ronan Berder](https://github.com/hunvreus), but is open source, and accepting pull requests over on [GitHub](https://github.com/pages-cms/pages-cms).

Taking a lot of the “good parts” found in other CMS tools, and a single configuration file, Pages CMS combines things into a sleek user interface.

Pages CMS includes lots of options for customization, you can upload [media](https://pagescms.org/docs/configuration/#media), make editable files, and create entire collections of content. Also, content can have all sorts of different fields, [check the docs](https://pagescms.org/docs/configuration/) for the full list of supported types, as well as completely [custom fields](https://pagescms.org/docs/custom-fields/).

There isn’t really a “back end” to worry about, as content is stored as flat files inside your git repository. Pages CMS provides folks the ability to manage the content within the repo, without needing to actually know how to use Git, and I think that’s neat.
